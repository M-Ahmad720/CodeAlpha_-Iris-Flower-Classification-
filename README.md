🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Machine Learning pipeline using the famous Iris flower dataset.
The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their measurements:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

We explore the data, preprocess it, train multiple ML models, evaluate performance, and finally save the best model for deployment.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is Iris Dataset
 which is widely used in machine learning for beginners.

150 samples

4 features (numeric)

3 target classes

⚙️ Project Workflow

Import Libraries → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Load & Explore Dataset → Shape, missing values, class distribution

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Visualization & feature relationships

Data Preprocessing → Label encoding, standardization, pipeline setup

Train-Test Split → 80% training, 20% testing

Model Training → Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest

Evaluation → Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

Hyperparameter Tuning → GridSearchCV for best parameters

Feature Importance → Analyze which features impact predictions most

Save Model → Using joblib for later use

📊 Results

Best Model: Random Forest Classifier 🌲

Accuracy: ~97% – 100% on test data

Most Important Features: Petal Length & Petal Width

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📌 Conclusion

This project shows how a simple dataset like Iris can be used to learn classification concepts.

We built an end-to-end ML pipeline: from EDA → Preprocessing → Training → Evaluation → Model Saving.

Achieved very high accuracy, making it a solid beginner-friendly ML project.
